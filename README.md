## Stock Portfolio
I set out to develop a stock portfolio web-app using Flask for the web layer and PostgreSQL for the database layer. The web-app would allow an investor to manage (view and trade) a portfolio of stocks using the publicly available Yahoo Finance API. 
Unfortunately, the endevaour proved to complicated given the time and resources at my disposal (1-person group) thus leaving me without a functioning application. 

In the sincere hope that I might be able to pass the project anyway, I have written about the project to demonstrate my knowledge of the course material.
